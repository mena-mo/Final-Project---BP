# Final-Project---BP
Final project for my beginning programming class. I think it could be better, honestly! This project was built on from another project from the same class where we were meant to create a web page revolving around school clubs with a group of people from class. This project was meant to be specifically for adding a mobile version of the site and was not a group project. While I think it could definitely use some more work, I think it is still okay.

I think in total, this project took around a little less than a month. Of course, it could've taken less but work and other projects got in the way. I also think if I had kept the original color scheme, it could've taken less time. I think the color scheme was actually one of the harder things to pick out, especially when it came to having a certaim amount of contrast. I think it looks a little, tiny bit horrendous, but at least the contrast is there xD. 

All of the images that have the FreePik link are from that site, all others were created by me using Krita.
